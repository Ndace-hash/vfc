Valiant Football Club (VFC) was an idea born in Lagos, Nigeria by passionate football enthusiasts. With connections to the domestic and global football scene, the founders developed the idea of starting a football club in Lagos to cater to the Nigeria grassroots football talents. VFC is a team that gives opportunities to the talented local and hungry football players who do not have a stage to showcase their skills. We aim to change the lives of all of those who are involved with the club for the better. The club is a member of the Nigerian Nationwide League (Division 3). In 2020, VFC became a founding member of The Creative Championship League.

The club is looking for collaborations with European clubs and agents who are looking for a strong youth development link to Nigeria. The medium-term vision of the club is to install a European level system so that players who come through the ranks are ready for the jump to Europe instantly
