<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6 text-primary">Club History</h1>

Valiant Football Club (VFC) was an idea born in Lagos, Nigeria by passionate football enthusiasts. With connections to the domestic and global football scene, the founders developed the idea of starting a football club in Lagos to cater to the Nigeria grassroots football talents. VFC is a team that gives opportunities to the talented local and hungry football players who do not have a stage to showcase their skills. We aim to change the lives of all of those who are involved with the club for the better. The club is a member of the Nigerian Nationwide League (Division 3). In 2020, VFC became a founding member of The Creative Championship League.

The club is looking for collaborations with European clubs and agents who are looking for a strong youth development link to Nigeria. The medium-term vision of the club is to install a European level system so that players who come through the ranks are ready for the jump to Europe instantly

The 3rd annual Global Football Scouting Tournament powered by Valiant FC will be held December 3-5, 2019. The tournament will host European scouts/club executives in Lagos for 3 days. 6teams will feature from Lagos in an effort to showcase their skills to the guests with their eye on being invited to Europe for a trial.

The previous tournaments which were held in Lagos the past 2 years, were very successful with scouts and agents from Norway and the UK attending as well as a club executive from Malta. Last edition a USA university assistant coach joined as well. The outcome was the invitation of several players to trial and the tracking of several more to see their progress in the next tournament. The scouts were happy with the level of players that they saw in Nigeria and believe there are many untapped potentials in the country.

As a club, our aim is to provide opportunities for players to excel in their careers and take the next steps to success. To do this, we work with only the most trustworthy and professional clubs out there. Through our partnership with playerâ€™s agent Abdelrahman, we are able to attract these football professionals to come to Nigeria and witness what the country has to offer.
